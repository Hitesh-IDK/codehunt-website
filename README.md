# CodeHunt - Web
A website which keeps track of both the competitors as well as the coordinators. <br>
The competition involved clues which had QR codes which could be scanned by the coordinators. The authenticated COORDINATORS will then provide the next clue while the system automatically updates in our database the place that was reached and the team and their position in the hunt. The whole competition could also be spectated by people who were not part of it.
